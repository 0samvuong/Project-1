We can’t put all our required columns into 1 Dataframe.

Our main DataFrame should only have 1 row for each accident – we get this from the ACCIDENT DataFrame, ACCIDENT_NO column.
For the other dataframes (node/weather/person/etc.), they most likely have multiple ACCIDENT_NO’s (which means multiple rows for 1 accident). If we try to merge those rows into the main DataFrame, we will get multiple rows for each accident (sort of), and that will ruin our main DataFrame. 

What to do now?
1)	Load all CSV files as its own DataFrame (I’ve done that already, mostly.)
	•	There should have around 10 
2)	Select the last 5 years of accidents (2015-2020), and put that in the Main DataFrame
	•	We now have the ACCIDENT_NO of all accidents in the last 5 years
3)	For all other DataFrames, make sure that they only contain rows that have the same ACCIDENT_NO as the main DataFrame
	•	Now all the DataFrames only have data for accidents for the last 5 years.
